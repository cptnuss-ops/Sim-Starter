# Sim-Starter

This program can be used to create an automated flow for starting programs. The intended use is any Flight simulation software like P3D, X-Plane 11, FSX, etc.
The repository contains the complete Visual Studio project and can be used according to the GNU V3 license.

If you just want to use the program, simply download the .exe file in the root directory of the repository and run in from any location on your PC.

INSTALLATION:
Download & run Sim-Starter.exe

INITIAL CONFIG:
To get the program to work correct, add programs via the button to the list. When done SAVE the list. This will create the SimStarterInit.txt file in \MyDocuments of your PC. This file will then be loaded every time the program is started.
However, the list can be edited and saved again anytime.

LOAD DIFFERENT CONFIGS:
If you run multiple sims or like to create different files, feel free! Via the Load button in the toolbar any file can be loaded.
The easiest way (for now) to create different configs, is to edit the list via the GUI, save it and copy it to a different folder/location and load for use.

!!! ATTENTION !!!
During first release no file format checking will be active! Make sure that the file extension is never changed from .txt !
Standard file is the SimStarterInit.txt in \MyDocuments. Different configs need to be loaded manually !
Basic exception handling is implemented, more to come...

If you encounter any problems, find bugs or just want to add wishes, feel free to do this on my GitHub project page!

Have fun !
